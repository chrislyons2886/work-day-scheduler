# work-day-scheduler

## Description

My motivation for this project was to help myself and other busy individuals with a scheduler that saves calendar events in local storage, in order to manage time more effectively.  Using a combination of JQuery, MomentJS and BootStrap, this daily planner comes to life.  When a user opens the calendar, the current date and clock run.  There are timeblocks for the hours 7 am - 7 pm.  As time passes, past hours are grayed out, the current hour is red, and future hours are green.  Local storage allows users to save their scheduled events in the calendar.
